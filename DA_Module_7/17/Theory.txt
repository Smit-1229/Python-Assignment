17) What are negative indexes and why are they used?

    =>  In Python, negative indexes allow you to access elements from the end of a sequence, such as a 
        list, string, or tuple, rather than from the beginning.

    =>  A positive index starts from 0 (the first element), while a negative index starts 
        from -1 (the last element), -2 (the second-last element), and so on.
