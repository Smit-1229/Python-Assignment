3) What is Python?

    =>  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
    
    =>  It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
    
    =>  Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax, making it beginner-friendly 
        while also being powerful for professionals.

    Features Of Python : 
        =>  Simple and Easy to Learn: 
                Python is the simplest and easiest to learn due to the 
                straight forward syntax, which reduces the complexity of code.

        =>  Interpreted Language:
                Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is
                executed line by line, which make easier to test and find error and fixed immediately.  

        =>  High-Level Language:
                Python abstracts the complexity of memory management, making it easier to write code 
                without worrying about lower-level operations (e.g., memory allocation).
