        It allows developers to detect, handle, and recover from exceptions that occur during the execution of the program.
        Key Components of Exception handlinds are :
                1.try block : it contains the code that might raise error exception.
                        If no error found it excecutes normally
                2.except block : it contains the code to handle specific exceptions.
